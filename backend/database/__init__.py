Database Configuration

Database setup and connection management:

1. Primary Database: Main write database
   - SQLite for simplicity
   - Write operations
   - Source of truth

2. Replica Databases: Read replicas
   - Eventually consistent reads
   - Load distribution for reads
   - Replication lag tracking

3. Migrations: Database schema management
   - Initial schema setup
   - Version control
   - Migration scripts

Note: For production, this would be PostgreSQL with streaming replication.
For this educational project, we use SQLite with simulated replication.
